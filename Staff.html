                    <p> My name is Bob Belcher. I am a second-generation restaurateur and the owner of Bob's Burgers. My passion for burgers began while working for my father's restaurant during my childhood. I loved making food that people enjoyed and experiment new recipes and flavours, however, my father would only want me to do things his way and that restricted my creative freedom a lot. That's when I knew I had to open up my own restaurant if I wanted to follow my dream. My favourite part of the day is thinking of new recipes for our "Burger of the day" special. I highly recommend trying it when you stop by our restaurant! I also enjoy spending time with my family and my best friend Teddy.

                    <p> Hi y'all! My name is Linda and I'm Bob's wife. I'm also the mother of Tina, Gene and Louise. Together, we run Bob's Burgers and have loads of fun doing it! I love musical theatre, the performing arts and I strongly believe that I could have a brilliant career as a dancer if my family didn't need me at the restaurant. I love joining my kids for adventures and I have a special talent to make any outing loads of fun. I'm always down for a good time! </p>

                    <p> Hello. My name is Tina. I'm the oldest child of Bob and Linda and I am in eigth grade. When I don't work at the restaurant or go to school, I spend my time writing erotic fanfiction about Jimmy Jr. or anyone I have a crush on at the time. I'm no hero. I put my bra on one boob at a time, just like everyone else. I also like to go on adventures with my siblings, Gene and Louise. </p>

                    <p> I'm Louise Belcher. I'm the brain of the operation and also the youngest of the bunch. You wanna speak business? You speak to me. I guess some people would describe me as manipulative because of the complex and ingenius plans I create to achieve my goals, but that's just loser mentality. When I'm not helping out at the restaurant, I always find some trouble to get into with my siblings and friends.</p>

                    <p> My name is Gene Belcher, aspiring musician slash mascot. I'm the middle child and people always say they can tell for some reason. I love playing various instruments and getting in trouble with my siblings and friends. </p>
