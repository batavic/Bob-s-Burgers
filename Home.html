                    Bob was raised on a farm outside of Lynden, WA, and, as a young man, after serving in the military and knowing he didn't want to farm, Bob found himself in need of a job. He found one flipping burgers and soon became the manager.

                    Bob's 50+ year journey in the restaurant business was launched when he got the opportunity to buy the restaurant when the owner decided to move on. Then, during the 70's, Bob bought and sold several fast food restaurants and bars, learning new lessons with each opportunity. By the early 80's the fast food business was being overrun by franchise systems and they were pushing out the small businesses. It was time for something new.

                    Bob knew he wanted a successful, casual dining restaurant with outstanding food and burgers that everyone loved. In 1982, Bob's Burgers & Brew was founded, featuring a simple menu of gourmet burgers and other favorites from previous restaurants, including a lounge for adult dining. The new restaurant caught on quickly.

                    Bob's Burgers & Brew became a second generation family business when Bob's children joined the business and helped open several new restaurants. With the dawn of the new century, Bob's started a new chapter with the opening of the first franchised restaurants. Together  they have continued to add new restaurants to the Bob's family, both family owned and franchised.
